* [part 2.2](https://github.com/trekdemo/dina-frontend-assessment-react/tree/part_2.2)

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`npm start`

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will
update build.js with any changes you wish to make.  This watcher is
based on [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and
[Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify), and it transforms
CoffeeScript syntax into standard JavaScript.

After starting the watcher, you can open `index.html` in your browser to
open the app.
